# 6. Enums and Pattern Matching

In this chapter, we'll explore _enumerations_ (often called _enums_). Enums let you define a type by listing its possible variants, allowing your code to work with different kinds of values more flexibly. We'll start by defining and using enums, showing how they can represent both meaning and data. Afterward, we''l introduce a commonly used enum in Rust, `Option`, which helps express whether a value exists or not.

Then, we'll dive into _pattern matching_ using the `match` expression, a powerful way to handle different enum variants with specific actions. Finally, we'll cover how the `if let` construct can simplify handling enums, offering a more concise and readable way to deal with specific cases.
