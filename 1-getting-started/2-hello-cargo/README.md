# 1.2. Hello, Cargo

This directory demonstrates using `cargo` to manage a Rust project.

## Project setup:

1. Create a new Cargo project:

```bash
cargo new 2_hello_cargo
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd 2_hello_cargo
```

## Building and Running:

1. Compiles the Rust code into an executable.

```bash
cargo build
```

2. Compiles and runs the project in a single step.

```bash
    cargo run
```

3. Checks the code for errors without building an executable.

```bash
    cargo check
```
