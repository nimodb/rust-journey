# 3.4. Data Types

In Rust, Every value is of a certain data type, which defines how the compiler interprets and manages that value. This is crucial because Rust is a _statically_ typed language, meaning the types of all variables must be known at compile time. Understanding data types helps you write more predictable and error-free code.

## Two Subsets of Data Types

Rust data types are broadly categorized into two subsets:

1. [Scalar Types](https://github.com/nimodb/rust-journey/tree/main/3-common-programming-concepts/4-data-types/1-scalar)
   - Scalar types represent a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.
2. [Compound Types](https://github.com/nimodb/rust-journey/tree/main/3-common-programming-concepts/4-data-types/2-compound)
   - Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.
