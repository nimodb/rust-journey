# 5. Using Structs to Structure Related Data

In Rust, struc (short for structure) is a custom data type that allows you to group multiple related values together, givin them meaningful names. This is similar to an object's data attributes in object-oriented languages, though structs in Rust focus in data rather then behavior.

In this chapter, we'll explore:

- **Comparing Tuples and Structs:** While both tuples and structs can group data, structs provide named fields, making your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Defining and Instantiating Structs:** Learn how to create structs with named fields and instantiate them with actual values.
- **Associated Functions and Methods:** We'll cover how to define functions associated with a struct, including methods that define behavior for struct instances.

Structs are one of Rust's fundamental building blocks, along with enums (discussed in Chapter 6), for defining new types in your program. By using structs effectively, you can fully leverage Rust's powerful compile-time type checking to write safer and more organized code.
