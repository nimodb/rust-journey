# Understanding Ownership

Ownership in Rust's most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, so it's important to understand how ownership works.

In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of ownership and how it underpins many of Rust's memory safety guarantees. We'll also dive into related features such as borrowing, slice, and how Rust lays out data in memory. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing safe and efficient Rust code. Let's begin by breaking down the ownership system and how it interacts with rest of the language.
